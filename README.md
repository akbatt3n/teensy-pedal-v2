# Teensy Pedal v2
An upgraded version of the teensy-based guitar pedal. This version aims to make the following improvements:
  * Additional effects - reverb and "synth"
  * Improved functionality - overdrive that works, synth sound with no latency, etc.
  * Better usability - more intuitive controls, more informative display
  * Improved enclosure design
  * Cleaner internals - PCB instead of spaghetti wires
  
The pedal is still based on the Teensy 3.6 and audio adaptor from pjrc.com. Currently all circuitry is for controls and the display; no filters, pre-amps or the like. Audio in/out connects to the audio adaptor.
